                    <p style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>The UK’s creative industries are more geographically concentrated than other sectors, and the trend seems to be towards more rather than less concentration, although the creative industries are not alone in this regard. The fact that we find strong creative concentration within regions too raises the possibility of developing regional creative champions, but also the risk of replicating the same creative inequalities inside regions that we see between them.

                        The creative industries have a role to play in closing the UK’s productivity gap, but this will require them to become more productive, and to increase the number of people working in larger (non-micro) creative businesses. But the greatest potential for this is in those regions where the creative industries are already based.

                        Creative clusters do not grow on their own: what happens in their neighbourhood is also important. Discrete interventions to support cluster development need to take into account the situation around it, and also consider potential growth spillovers which might benefit the creative industries nearby. There is a risk that these spillovers might not be given due attention even though they are a positive outcome for UK creative industries regionally and nationally.

                        <span style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold', }}>Policy Implications of Creative Specialisms: </span>
                        Our analysis suggests that those places with strong creative specialisms see those strengths spread into other industries, potentially making them more innovative and productive. This is an important lesson for the Industrial Strategy and for Local Enterprise Partnerships and other agencies charged with local economic development. Policymakers should take this into account and seek to enhance these creative spillovers when they develop new policies to strengthen creative clusters.

                        Growth dynamics in creative industries and their clusters are not as simple as policymakers sometimes assume: high-growth firms are important, but so are steadily growing micro businesses; creative cities are accompanied by creative districts and creative conurbations among other models. The art that creative policymakers and practitioners need to master is to harness the opportunities opened up by their existing economic structures and growth models, while managing their risks. This requires awareness of the local context, and detailed, timely data.
